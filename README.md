Orilly book is preferred for book readers.

## First Determine your level:
### <a href="#beginner">Beginner</a>

we can start by the docs, but visual readers won't like it so much :(

1- https://laravel.com/docs/

the best tutorials you will see is at Laracasts.com
please note :                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

don't install the latest version of laravel, because there are some improvements in laravel versions, so the best thing is to follow the tutorials in the same version as the instructor then see what is new in the later versions  

 https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-6-from-scratch

after you finish the series you will have to know that is new in laravel 7 and 8 .

these two series are 1-hour long series that will tell you everything new to the framework, so you can stay up to date

Laravel 7 : https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-7

Laravel 8 : https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-8

after you implement Tweety app (in the laravel 6 series) you will follow these tutorials where you will build an instagram clone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImtZ5yENzgE

in the last beginner level you will build a blog website and/or e-business website on your own!!
consider this as a final beginner task 
you can use this document as reference to system requirements

https://thescipub.com/pdf/ajeassp.2012.266.274.pdf

or you can use a design template and turn it to a complete website:

example :  
https://bootstrapmade.com/ebusiness-bootstrap-corporate-template/download/

note that admin dashboard is required !!

you can use any admin dashboard (mentioned in the slides)


expected time to finish this phase is fully dependent on your hard work and passion

now you must have basic understanding to the framework that could get you to the next level
