## php Roadmap 
1- Getting to know the basics

Arabic :

- https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoPjvoNmBAzH72MTPuAAaYfReraNlQgM

English:

- https://laracasts.com/series/php-for-beginners

Example projects are a must:

- https://www.upgrad.com/blog/php-project-ideas-topics-for-beginners/

Pick  2-4 projects, search them very well and analyze them then code them in php

2- oop

Arabic :

- https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoPjvoNmBAxXTPncg0W4lhVS32LO_xtQ

English :

You will need to get a subscription

- https://laracasts.com/series/object-oriented-bootcamp-in-php

https://laracasts.com/series/design-patterns-in-php

If you want free

- https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0eyrZgxdwhypQiZnYXM7z7-OTkcMgGPh

But the subscription is preferred.

Now turn the four projects you applied to apply oop concepts and connect it to database

This book is a must-read and this tutorial is a must-read as well, but it's paid, there is also free trial

1- Orilly videos

- https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/getting-started-with/9781786460226/

2- orilly book

- [https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-php-4th/9781492054122/](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-php-4th/9781492054122/)

Orilly book is preferred for book readers.

## Laravel Roadmap:
### <a href="#beginner">Beginner</a>

we can start by the docs, but visual readers won't like it so much :(

if you like reading ( if not skip to tutorials ) both would be great!

 - https://laravel.com/docs/


 - laravel up and running 2nd edition

the best tutorials you will see is at Laracasts.com
please note :                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

- don't install the latest version of laravel, because there are some improvements in laravel versions, so the best thing is to follow the tutorials in the same version as the instructor then see what is new in the latter versions  

- some courses at Laracasts require subscription ( if it needs i will mention it and give alternatives but laracasts is the best!)

### The basics and beyond
 - https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-6-from-scratch

after you finish the series you will have to know that is new in laravel 7 and 8 .

these two series are 1-hour long series that will tell you everything new to the framework, so you can stay up to date

Laravel 7 : 
- https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-7

Laravel 8 : 
- https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-8

after you implement Tweety app (in the laravel 6 series) you will follow these tutorials where you will 
### build an instagram clone ( project playlist )
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImtZ5yENzgE

### projects you will apply ( on your own with search and referring to docs ) after finishing the previous
in the last beginner level you will build a blog website and/or e-business website on your own!!
consider this as a final beginner task 
you can use this document as reference to system requirements

- https://thescipub.com/pdf/ajeassp.2012.266.274.pdf

or you can use a design template and turn it to a complete website:

example :  
- https://bootstrapmade.com/ebusiness-bootstrap-corporate-template/download/

note that admin dashboard is required !!

you can use any admin dashboard (mentioned in the slides)

the second task is to make yourself a website cv where you can add your works, services, portfolio, biography and all to be controlled using a dashboard 
you can use any of these templates :
- https://bootstrapmade.com/bootstrap-resume-cv-templates/



expected time to finish this phase is fully dependent on your hard work and passion

now you must have basic understanding to the framework that could get you to the next level
   


### <a href="#intermediate">Intermediate</a>
now you need to be familiar with some advanced topics such as:

### laravel best practices
